```lrc
[00:07.21] I've listened endlessly to your injury
[00:09.65] You wanna talk about your sores
[00:11.34] You wanna talk about suffering
[00:13.08] Maybe sympathy it's all you're really hungry for
[00:15.55] 'Cause you just criticize and you fingerpoint
[00:17.79] And you say that they put you down
[00:19.42] You may be victimized but you're still the one
[00:22.18] Who won't just get up off the ground
[00:40.18] 
[00:23.63] I used to be as innocent as you
[00:28.68] My excuses ran out, ran out of things to complain about
[00:31.95] Fear will always find a way to show right through
[00:56.45] 
[00:38.73] You want to be more hurt than me
[00:42.77] You want to say you're more the victim
[00:47.07] You wanna complain and pass the blame
[00:51.05] You want to say you're more the victim
[01:10.05] 
[00:56.36] You want, you-you you want, you-you you want, you-you you wanna talk constantly about misery
[01:01.86] And how you've been done so wrong
[01:03.75] You wanna badge your honеsty and exaggerate
[01:05.86] All thе stress that you undergone
[01:07.62] There's never a compromise, no one can say
[01:09.99] That they ever been hurt before
[01:11.63] They may be victimized, but you'll always say
[01:14.25] That you're a victim so much more
[01:30.75] 
[01:16.04] I used to be as innocent as you
[01:20.78] My excuses ran out, ran out of things to complain about
[01:24.23] Fear will always find a way to show right through
[01:48.73] 
[01:30.42] You want to be more hurt than me
[01:34.84] You want to say you're more the victim
[01:39.00] You wanna complain and pass the blame
[01:42.78] You want to say you're more the victim
[02:01.78] 
[01:48.07] You wanna be just another someone
[01:52.52] Somebody angry, somebody broken
[01:56.83] You wanna be that, than being all alone
[02:16.33] 
[02:06.82] You want to be more hurt than me
[02:10.82] You want to say you're more the victim
[02:15.20] You wanna complain and pass the blame
[02:19.12] You want to say you're more the victim
[02:23.13] You want to be more hurt than me
[02:26.77] You want to say you're more the victim
[02:30.85] You wanna complain and pass the blame
[02:35.32] Pass the blame, pass the blame
